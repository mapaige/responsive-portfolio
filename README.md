# Portfolio
`index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
This project was about making a responsive site using technologies such as HTML, CSS and bootstrap. We did so by adding 3 html files and 1 CSS file to make the files link together onced the user pressed the items in the nav bar.  CSS was used to create colors and aligning the site where Bootstrap elements would not work.
