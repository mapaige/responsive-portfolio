                  <p>My name is Marcia Paige. I am often called Marcia Angelique. I am currently enrolled in University of Richmond Boot Camp for Coding. My ultimate goal is to do freelance web development to help a community of small businesses that are in need of a updated or new web presence.
                    
                  <p>I ran an organization called "Chief in Stilettos". It held an annual event called "Little Black Dress Night", a networking event for women in business to have fun and potentially meet other business owners to build relationships to increase their network and network.<p>
